    <h4 class="h2-title"><br>I'm Kiernan Proud. I am a senior at Nazareth College, double majoring in business management and marketing, and minoring in communication and media. At Nazareth, I am a member of the Social Media Team, and work as a Peer Career Advisor for the Center for Life's Work. I also work for the Development Office, and serve as chairman of the Senior Class Campaign Committee. I will graduate in May 2018. <br> <br>

I am a former Butler/Till Media Intern, where during the summer of 2017, I worked on projects for clients like Excellus BlueCross BlueShield and Causewave Community Partners. <br><br>

Previously, I attended Oswego High School, where I played guitar in the Jazz Band. I was also Treasurer of Interact Club, where I was able to volunteer for numerous charities in the community. <br><br>

I fell in love with marketing after taking courses in Social Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, Writing for Digital Media and Digital Marketing. I am passionate about driving results and achieving goals for clients.  </h4>
